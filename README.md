# Project Overview

Given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Included with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) starter code. The challenge was to complete the test suite.

## How to Run
- Clone this Repository.
- Inside the cloned folder, run index.html.

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## Objectives

1. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
2. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
3. Write a new test suite named `"The menu"`.
4. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default.
5. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
6. Write a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`.
7. Write a test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container.
8. Write a test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`.
9. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.
